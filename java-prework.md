# Introduction 

The purpose of this Prework unit is to get you "warmed up" for the main event, your 12-week immersive course with TIY. It's to allow you to come to class on day 1, ready and prepared to get started right away. Take your time to go through this material, but make sure you do get through it all. Remember that whatever you can absorb here, you will not need to catch up to during the first few days of class. Preparation is a key to success, and this is your chance to prepare to succeed in your 12-week class! 

# Computer Setup

You can have either a Windows-based computer or an OS X (Apple) computer. Either way, we recommend the following specifications as a minimum: 

* Full HD (1920x1080) resolution
* SSD storage (at least 256GB) (vs a traditional Hard Drive)
* 8 GB of RAM
* Intel i7 processor (or equivalent)

# Installing programs: 

In the next few sections, you will be downloading files from the internet. Once the download is complete, double-click the file to run it, and then follow the instructions to complete the installation. Once the installation is complete, you will have access to the program you installed. 

## Browser: Google Chrome

Chrome is our browser of choice. It's fast, reliable and has great developer tools (more on that later during our class). [Download it here](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)

Once the download is complete, install Chrome (accept all the defaults) and start it. When Chrome asks if you want to make it the "default browser", select the "yes" option. 

## Programming Language: Java 

What's a programming language, you may be wondering? 

It's the way we, humans, communicate with computers. Just as I'm communicating with you in English at the moment, and not Spanish, Mandarin or French, there are also many programming languages we could use to communicate with computers. For this class, we will use Java as our primary programming language, although we will touch on a few others as well. 

When you write words in a programming language, there are steps that need to take place in order to translate those words into the computer's native language. We will delve into that as well, but for now, just know that you need something called a "development kit" in order to program in a specific language. 
Go ahead and download the Java Development Kit (JDK) from [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

Once the download is complete, install the JDK (accept all the defaults). Once the JDK installation is complete, start a command prompt: 

* On Windows: Windows menu -> All apps -> Windows System -> Command Prompt
* On a Mac: Press Apple Key and the Space Bar to bring up the universal search box and type "terminal" and hit the Enter key

At the prompt, type the following:

`javac -version`

That should display something along the lines of (don't worry if it's not exactly the same): 

`javac 1.8.0_25"`

* Note for Windows users: if the command prompt cannot find `javac`, it's probably because it's not part of your path. Here is a link for instructions on how to add `javac` to your path: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/windows/jdk-installation-windows.html#path 

You now have the JDK installed and configured, which means you can now "speak" Java and your computer will understand you! 

## Text editor: Sublime Text

We can't quite literally "speak" Java to our computers, so we need a text editor to actually "type" the words we need to communicate to the computer. Notepad (Windows default) and Textedit (OS X default) are not very good editors, so we don't be using them. 

For the purpose of pre-course work and the first few days of class, we will use Sublime Text, which you should download from [here](https://download.sublimetext.com/Sublime%20Text%20Build%203103%20x64%20Setup.exe)

Once the download is complete, install Sublime Text with all the defaults. 

(Sublime has a "paid" version and will remind you of that every once in a while. You don't need to buy Sublime, and you can continue using the free version)

Later, we will use something called an "Integrated Development Environment", which will give us many tools to make our job of creating programs in Java easier. We will use the IntelliJ IDEA IDE, which you can download [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=IIC)

Go ahead and download and install IntelliJ now, but don't worry about learning how to use it just yet. 

# Done with initial setup

Your computer is now configured with the essential tools you need to be able to start creating computer programs in Java! We will get started doing just that on Day 1, so make sure you reach out to me (dominique@theironyard.com) if you had issues with any of the steps above. 

# Homework

Now that your own computer is set up properly, there are a few more things for you to do in order to prepare for Day 1

## Start learning to speak Java

1. Work through parts 1 and 2 of [the KTByte Interactive Algorithms Textbook in Java](https://www.ktbyte.com/java-tutorial/book)
2. Work through the [Codeacademy course on Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java)


## Learn to speak the "languages of the web"

HTML and CSS are basically the languages of the web, so even though they will not be our primary focus, we will need a basic knowledge of both. 

* Work through [Codeacademy course on HTML & CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web)

## Learn the basics of "version control"

Imagine writing a letter to a friend you care about a lot. You have things to say, but you want to choose your words carefully. "Version Control" allows you to save your letter every time you think you've gotten to a good point. You can then continue writing it later, come back to a previous version or ask another friend to review it for you and make their own changes.

The system we will be using for version control is called "Git": 

* Windows: [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) on your computer (accept all the defaults)
* OS X: [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) on your computer (accept all the defaults)
* Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) (GitHub is the most popular Git host on the internet)
* Work through the [Try GitHub](https://try.github.io/) course on how to use Git

Make sure to add a profile picture and your full name to your GitHub profile, as that will help me learn your name. 

# Deliverables

Send me an email (dominique@theironyard.com) with the following: 

* Your GitHub username
* Any questions (absolutely any questions) you have from going through the above
* Your thoughts on what you think is going to be most difficult for you during this 12-week immersive Java class
